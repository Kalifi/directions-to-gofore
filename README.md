# Directions to the Gofore office in Kamppi 
Getting to the office can be a daunting task for any first time visitor. Luckily we have created easy directions that you can follow all the way through.

**Note! These directions assume that you can find you own way to Kamppi.**

Our office is located in Urho Kekkosen katu 7 B as shown in the map below.
